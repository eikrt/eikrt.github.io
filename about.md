Hello! I'm a student at University of Turku with ICT as my major. Here you can find all sorts of things I'm working on.

At the moment I'm mostly interested in \*nix environments, system administration, GameBoy and NES assembly among other things. I have four years of software development experience at work. 

Music and films also inspire me hugely. Some of my favourite films are Last Year In Marienbad and all production by David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick. My favourite band is King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, and I enjoy everything by Frank Zappa (especially the last albums) and King Crimson. Jazz, especially Miles Davis and John Coltrane have a soft spot in my heart. A Love Supreme is potentially my favourite album ever!

On the literature side of things I enjoy scifi greatly. Dune, Solaris and Cyberiad are some of my favourites. One Hundred Years of Solitude is perhaps my favourite book though.
