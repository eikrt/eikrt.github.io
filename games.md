## Freakout

This is an iteration of a Breakout/Arkanoid style game. You can play a minified version of it in browser, but I suggest building it on your own machine from [Github](https://www.github.com/eikrt/freakout). This project exists for demonstrating the possibilities of WebAssembly and writing C to the browser.
