## Freakout

This is an iteration of a Breakout/Arkanoid style game. You can play a version of it in browser, but I suggest building it on your own machine from [Github](www.github.com/eikrt/freakout). The game is playable on the browser, but it's slow because it uses pixel by pixel rendering due to experimental reasons. We may see some interesting applications to that in the future, but for now it's just a basic game.

[Play now!](/freakout/)
