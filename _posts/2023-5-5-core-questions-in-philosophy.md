I read the book "Core questions in philosophy" by Elliott Sober, and it provoked some thoughts. The book starts with defining philosophy, and provides three theories:

- it asks and tries to answer *general* questions
- it asks *fundamental questions of justification*
- it is "the enterprise of *clarifying concepts*"

These are good points, but I'm more interested what do the terms in italic actually mean. Philosophy has gone through different set of interesting phases, namely in the Ancient Greek, where natural philosophy was practiced. As an example, Greek philosopher Democritus deducted, that all matter consisted of smaller undivided particles, *atoms* [1]. These kind of questions are somewhat irrelevant in modern philosophy, as physics studies them more thoroughly. The philosophers of Ancient Greek were not stupid, however, they actually were very adequate philosophers in a sense that they didn't have the modern science to back up their practice of studies. They didn't have something called physics, and for that reason, the heavy lifting of every theoretical branch of thinking was upon philosophers.

## Generality

What do we mean with the *general* nature of philosophy? Generality doesn't refer to the fact that the questions couldn't be specific, but I like to think that they are at a different layer of viewing the question (fig. 1). The more we delve deeper in a question, the more relevance of a different branch of more specific study (physics) gets. 

Figure 1:

|What are falling, apples and trees?|
|Do apples always fall from trees?|
|Why do apples fall from trees?|
|How does gravity work?|

One interesting feature of philosophy that we can continue asking more and more general questions. A basic general question of a branch of philosophy, ethics is "what is right and what is wrong". With the use of ethics, we can try to answer this as best as we can, but we can ascend to a more general level: metaethics. Metaethics poses questions what is ethics, is there ethical knowledge (moral epistemology) and so on [2]. We can see that these levels of "meta" can be applied to practically any scientific question, but what is the most general questions we can ask? Are they ontologic, epistemologic I don't know.

## Fundamental questions of justification

Elliot Sober states that "common knowledge" oppose fundamental questions of justification. Common sense is something that you can have an immediate opinion, e.g. 1+1=2. Rarely we discuss that what is the justification of such statement, but we could justify them with the use of Peano axioms, but can we justify the axioms itself? For justification, we have to rely on different theories, for which I suggest reading the [article](https://openstax.org/books/introduction-philosophy/pages/7-3-justification) at Openstax.

## Clarifying concepts

Sober states in the first chapter of the book that philosophy clarifies context with *reason* and *observation*. Philosophical questions deviate from other branches of science, e.g. "what is physics" vs. "what is gravity". We clarify these concepts by answering questions not with "proofs", but with "arguments". Through centuries we have clarified many concepts, e.g in ethics. One could think that different arguments just distort our way of reality â€“ but relying on common knowledge just puts us back, especially in practical questions. Some people's common sense gravitates towards an utilitarianist point of view, without them even aknowledging it. As they lack the knowledge of philosophy of utilitarianism, they sadly haven't got the resources to challenge their extremely problematic ethical footprint.

## Closing words

These three views are supposed to be challenged, as they can't singularly define philosophy. They are supposed to be "taken with a grain of salt" as mentioned by Sober. However, we now have something interesting to grasp on when discussing *metaphilosophy* the act of philosophising philosophy.
